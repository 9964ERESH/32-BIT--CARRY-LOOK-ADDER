# 32-BIT--CARRY-LOOK-ADDER
The parallel adder is a ripple carry adder type in which the carry output of each full-adder stage is connected to the carry 
input of the next higher-order stage. Therefore, the sum and carry outputs of any stage cannot be produced until the input 
carry occurs; this leads to a time delay in the addition process. This delay is known as carry propagation delay. 
One method of speeding up this process by eliminating inter stage carry delay is called look ahead-carry addition.
